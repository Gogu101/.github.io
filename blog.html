  <h2>Why did I make this specific study choice?</h2>
  <p>
    I started exploring multiple subject until I found one I like and started working more on that. I also wanted to find a university outside my country and looked on the internet and attended university fairs until I found one that I think suits me.I chose this study programme because during high school I discovered that informatics is actually pretty interesting. I do believe that IT is important for the future development of the world and int the future I want to make something that I like and is also useful.After graduating I would like to work at a multinational or start my own company. I want to be either a software engineer or a game developer, because I belive that there are a lot of opportunities in these areas.
