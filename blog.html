    <h2>Why did I make this specific study choice?</h2>
  <p>
    I started exploring multiple subject until I found one I like and started working more on that. I also wanted to find a university outside my country and looked on the internet and attended university fairs until I found one that I think suits me.I chose this study programme because during high school I discovered that informatics is actually pretty interesting. I do believe that IT is important for the future development of the world and int the future I want to make something that I like and is also useful.After graduating I would like to work at a multinational or start my own company. I want to be either a software engineer or a game developer, because I belive that there are a lot of opportunities in these areas.

    <h2>My strenghts and weaknesses</h2>
  <p>I work pretty good in teams, I make friends easy, adapt fast in different situations but I think that I get distracted easily and I don't really get out of my comfort zone.My lack of attention sometimes makes it hard to learn sometimes, but I plan to change that soon and I can start moving out of my comfort zone and look for new things to do and learn and combine things I like with the new ones.</p>

    <h2>Programming experience</h2>
  <p>During high school I had C++ classes for 4 years,we did some HTML and CSS for a bit and in my free time I learned some JavaScript and some Python</p>

    <h2>First feedback and some thoughts about it</h2>
  <p>Your motivation is nice but still a bit too general, why are you interested in ICT? What would you like to create in the future? What makes you interested in this study program in particular? I recommend you check what interests you most about this type of career and to search for the true motivation that will keep you going throughout the study program. This will be very helpful in difficult situations or challenges that you may encounter during your education.-I tried giving as much informations as I could.At the time I was completing this I was still a bit unsure of what I really wanted to do.</p>
  <p>When looking at your goals after completing the studies, it is nice to see you are interested in becoming a software engineer. Besides working on code, what else do you enjoy in being a software engineer? Why would you enjoy becoming a game developer? I would recommend you to try and research more about software engineering  pr game developing but maybe other positions as well just to understand your options, what would you like to do in your day to day? How would you like your role to look like? Look more into the program, what interests you in the courses taught. I also recommend you participate in the ICT conference upcoming year where youll meet companies and can get more information about different professions in the ICT field.-I now realize that i was not specific about why I wanted to be a software engineer but everything was specified in the <a href="index.html">Home</a> section.</a></p>
  <p>Looking at your SWOT analysis I can see you can identify some of your strengths and weaknesses. It is nice to hear you feel comfortable in teams and feel social, that it a good attribute to have when studying and when working in projects with groups. To help you with the distractions, try and think what maybe can help you concentrate, perhaps schedule fun activities or small rewards when you accomplish an assignment? It will help you during your studies and in the future.-No comment here.</p>
